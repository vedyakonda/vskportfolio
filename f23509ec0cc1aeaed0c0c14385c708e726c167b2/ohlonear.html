      <p class="over">Along with Santa Clara University's Imaginarium and Community Heritage Lab, I am currently working on a project using 3D modeling and Augmented Reality (AR) to pair a “one-ness” between the past pain and difficulties that the Ohlone tribe faced historically and the erasure the community continue to face today. By recreating their land and customs through Augmented Reality, I hope to bring their truth to the forefront. It should be noted that the digitization of Ohlone artifacts is supported by Ohlone collaborators, who are driving the public memory process to broadly educate and inform the public of its culture and history. While working on this project, I have been working in direct collaboration with the Indigenous people to authenticate that everything that we present is accurate and a fair representation. </p>

      <p class = "over">The Indigenous Ohlone of Thamien lived on the grounds of present-day Santa Clara University thousands of years prior to the establishment of Mission Santa Clara in 1777 and Santa Clara University in 1851. While their history and culture is integral to Santa Clara University's campus, only few students are aware of the significance of the land that they live and learn on. The awareness of the tribe's story is vital to the cultural development of this campus as it brings awareness to the pain and difficulties that the Ohlone tribe faced and continue to face today. By recreating their land and customs through Augmented and Virtual Reality, we hope to decolonize their story and bring their truth to the forefront.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="over"> After having detailed conversations with the Ohlone Tribe and my mentors, Dr. Amy Lueck and Dr. Lee Panich, I decided to start my process by working on modeling the Tule Houses that the Ohlone tribe used to live in. I went through the sorted documentation given to me by the Community Heritage Lab and also made a visit to the Santa Clara University museum to see the wall paintings. Drawing inspiration from different pictures I created two kinds of Tule houses to be augmented onto Santa Clara University's campus. </p>

      <p class="over">To test out the tule house in AR, I first started with using Adobe Aero. Aero also made it easy for me to record and send videos to the tribe and my mentors who could easily give me feeback before I officially implemented it. Once the house was flushed out and ready to be placed, I used AR.js to implement the house into real life.    </p>

      <p class="over"> I continued to work on the Third Mission Church, which was a Mission Chirch on our campus that was destroyed. Also during this process, with the help of the Imaginarium Lab and Cultural Heritage Lab, I was able to get a 3D modeler to help me out with finishing these faster. We are currently continuing to model the rest of the structures and will hopefully have a version 1 of the AR tour by the end of this school year. </p>
