      <p class="over">INRIX is a Traffic Analytics company that delivers innovative products for the automotive and transportation industries such as real-time parking and traffic information and solutions that facilitate the safe testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles.</p>
      <p class="over">During my first internship at INRIX, I conducted and took part in brainstorming sessions, customer interviews, competitive analysis, and design reviews, among other tasks. As one of the two UX interns for the summer of 2021, I worked on two projects for the company- the Live Scorecard and the initial designs for a new Volumes Data Visualization product. Here is a detailed walkthrough of the process of creating the Live Scorecard.</p>

      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Defining the problem:  </h4>
      <p class = "over">As part of the intern team, I worked on creating design concepts for a new product, the INRIX Live Scorecard. I was tasked to visualize and communicate all types of traffic data that INRIX collected, including data on congestion, collisions, and dangerous slowdowns. The purpose of the scorecard was to serve as an INRIX product, as well as a marketing tool that would allow customers to understand the strength and implications of INRIX's data.</p>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Stakeholder Interviews:    </h4>
      <p class = "over">As part of the UX process, I was involved in triweekly stand-ups with the marketing team to understand their vision and goals for this project so that we could create a tool that was most accessible for them. This was a back-and-forth process, as I presented my design changes and iterations to gather stakeholder feedback as well as get more direction, clarity, and approval for my designs.</p>
       <h4 class = "sstitle"> Competitive Analysis:     </h4>
      <p class = "over">To understand the players in the industry I analyzed the competitors of INRIX to get a better understanding of what we were trying to achieve and differentiate through our product. We not only worked to make a Scorecard that was updating live but also tried to find ways to creatively visualize data so that we would remove a step from Journalists' research processes.</p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Ideation</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Concept Exploration: </h4>
      <p class = "over">As the user experience designer I was given the freedom to come up with ways that would best describe INRX’s data in ways that were useful and telling of the data’s intricacies and complexities. As part of this process, I collaborated with stakeholders and engineers at INRIX to discuss my ideas and hear their thoughts about the data. Some of the ways through which I decided to showcase the data included charts and graphical visualizations that would showcase the transitions of the traffic metrics.</p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Wireframing: </h4>
      <p class = "over">This process gave the freedom to explore ways in which the data could be presented to the users. I explored and adopted unique methods that would present raw data in digestible forms to every kind of user. After defining the structure of the page, I made more clarity as to where and how the visualizations, key information, and action items could be placed. Since the overall idea of all the pages of the scorecard was the same, this process enabled me to create one strong wireframe that could be replicated for the following pages. </p>

      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Feedback from leads, stakeholders and customers:   </h4>
      <p class = "over">The successive stakeholder interviews as well as the feedback sessions with the design leads helped me strengthen my design ideas and user journey flows. They helped me interpret the data in different ways as well as helped me ideate new ways to better the experience by focusing more on hierarchy, spacing, and incorporating INRIX’s predefined design tools.</p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Visual Design:  </h4>
      <p class = "over">After receiving valuable feedback on my wireframes and initial design direction, I iterated on multiple ideas based on inputs from leads and my design rationale. I explored different options for each section to find the design solution that fits best with the intent of the scorecard and what is the easiest to comprehend and consume. </p>

      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Final Deliverable: </h4>
      <p class = "over">My final product included all five pages of the scorecard that I had worked on. All of them have a similar design language and appearance catered towards describing INRIX's powerful data and traffic insights. this product would be used for marketing purposes to attract attention to INRIX as well as provide different cities with key information about their traffic conditions. </p>

      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Lessons Learned: </h4>
      <p class = "over">This was the first time that I was able to work on a project’s UX from start to finish. Before starting my internship, I had thought that design was one-dimensional and all about making something pleasing to the eye. However, by the end of the summer, I understood how important it is to design thoughtfully and effectively, and sometimes, everything that comes before you even starts designing anything is the most important part of the process.  </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Reflection:</h4>
      <p class = "over">I am extremely grateful for having the chance to work on a project and see it through to the development stage as well. Being able to go from ideation to deployment was a challenge, but a huge learning experience that I will take so much away from. I am truly grateful to my intern partner, Aditya Relan, for helping me and working on this project with me, as well as, my two mentors Tony Yates and Tony Jacobson who helped us no matter the time. I am also truly grateful to everyone who gave us feedback and insights on this project, especially Bryan, the CEO of INRIX.  </p>
