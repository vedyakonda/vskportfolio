      <p class="over">While my team at SwingBeats was presenting at a conference, an investor reached out to us as he had a shared interest in dance education. He wanted us to create an app for his friend who is a dance instructor. At many workshops he had conducted, the dance instructor had noticed that beginner students had difficulty finding the “1” in the song. They wanted us to create an app that solved such a problem for beginner dance students. </p>
      <p class="over">I spent a short few weeks working on designing and iterating this one-screened app that catered to the liking of the investor.</p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Initial Steps</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Stakeholder Interviews:    </h4>
      <p class = "over">As this project was given to us by the investor, my first step was to contact him and understand what and why he wanted to create it. He explained this as a tool for beginner dance learners who are possibly older in age and looking to have fun. This could be people trying to pick up dance for the first time as a hobby, or maybe just to dance at a wedding. He also wanted to make sure that the tool was functional for all people regardless of their abilities, so he wanted to make sure that there was a way to have the beats vibrate or play the beats out loud. </p>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Defining the problem:    </h4>
      <p class = "over">As part of the UX process, I was involved in triweekly stand-ups with the marketing team to understand their vision and goals for this project so that we could create a tool that was most accessible for them. This was a back-and-forth process, as I presented my design changes and iterations to gather stakeholder feedback as well as get more direction, clarity, and approval for my designs.</p>
       <h4 class = "sstitle"> Competitive Analysis:     </h4>
      <p class = "over">I defined the purpose of this application as a tool to help older dance learners who were starting this process for the first time. I also defined the potential customer as someone who was challenged when it came to keeping the beat during a song. </p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Ideation</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Concept and Competitive Research:  </h4>
      <p class = "over">As this was just an idea when I was given the prompt, I had to explore all of the other existing apps before starting. I noticed that there were many existing metronome apps in the market, however, there were none that also had the beat count of each verse. While having the beat count of each verse is vital while learning how to dance, I decided that this was an important aspect to integrate. I also chose to focus on a design that catered to songs that followed an 8-count as that is the most common beat pattern in songs.</p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Wireframing: </h4>
      <p class = "over">I chose to follow the theme of other metronome apps I had seen, but also have a tinge of originality to set this app apart. I added the beat count at the bottom but kept the bpm seen in many other metronome apps.  </p>
      <center><img class = "metro" src="img/metro1.png"></center>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Feedback from stakeholders:   </h4>
      <p class = "over">However, as I was showcasing my initial wireframes to the stakeholders (the investor and his dance instructor friend), they pointed out that while this was a metronome app and needed to have the best, the bpm wasn’t important to the user. The dancer doesn’t care how fast the song is as long as they are able to stay with the beat of the song that they are learning. The dance instructor also expressed to me at this point how he wanted to emphasize the one in each beat pattern. He told me how most beginners struggle the most with finding the “one” in the verse and how it needed to be emphasized to be catered to the potential customer.</p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Visual Design:  </h4>
      <p class = "over">After receiving this valuable feedback, I took some time to work on everything that they had expressed and come back with a revised design. </p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Final Steps</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Final Review with the stakeholders:  </h4>
      <p class = "over">After a few more back and forths regarding the design, I understood exactly what the stakeholders were looking for. They wanted a particular graph, instead of the earlier ones that I had shown. This helped me craft my final iteration. </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Final Deliverable:  </h4>
      <p class = "over">My final product included all the feedback I had received. The graph emphasized the first beat while also showing the vibration patterns that the beat was creating. It also had the functionality to turn the vibration or sounds of the beats on/off. </p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Takeaways</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Lessons Learned: </h4>
      <p class = "over">I had an enriching experience working on this project as it was my first time working on a mobile app design as well as working directly and purposefully for a client. I learned that when you are working with a client, your main goal is to appease them and to find and build what they truly want for the product.  </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Reflection:</h4>
      <p class = "over">I am grateful to the team that I work with at SwingBeats for helping me through this project. As this project came to us through the work that we do at SwingBeats, it was exciting to have something come out of something else we had worked on, It was a new and fun process and I couldn’t have done it without all the inputs of my team and Professor Navid Shaghaghi.  </p>
