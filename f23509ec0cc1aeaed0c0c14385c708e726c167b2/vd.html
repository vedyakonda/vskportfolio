      <p class="over">INRIX is a Traffic Analytics company that delivers innovative products for the automotive and transportation industries such as real-time parking and traffic information and solutions that facilitate the safe testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. </p>
      <p class="over">During my second internship at INRIX, I was tasked to head a team of interns who were working on a project called Virtual Drone. Hundreds of millions of dollars each year are spent in the US to operate and maintain camera networks. This product hopes to replace traffic cameras in the future by using individual dots on a map to represent individual vehicles moving through traffic in real time.  </p>

      <h1 class="bbtitle">Design Process</h1>
      <h1 class="btitle">Initial Steps</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Defining the problem:     </h4>
      <p class = "over">At the beginning of the internship, my team of five interns (me and 4 developers) was given a prompt to work on depicting individual dots moving on a map so that individual vehicles could be seen moving through and interacting with the live traffic. This would help to identify traffic anomalies for customers like the Department of Transportation or any other traffic engineers who look at traffic cameras on a daily basis. It was also told to us that this would be the start of a new product for INRIX that would hopefully get picked up to work on by the full-time senior devs in the company based on our end-of-the-internship presentation in September.
      <br>
      While I started off with writing stories and delegating tasks to the other interns, I quickly realized that this project was a lot more complex than what we would be able to accomplish in three months. As a TPM, I was trying to scope the project to fit our internship schedule and have something at the end of the internship that could be passed off to the full-time developers to continue working on. However, as a designer, I saw that this project had a lot more scope to explore.   </p>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Stakeholder Interviews: </h4>
      <p class = "over">While we were given very specific tasks to finish during our three months, I was not satisfied with just knowing the requirements given to us. I decided to understand the potential user better so I asked to talk to my manager, skip level, and other stakeholders of the project to learn more about the use cases for such a tool; this is what I was given: If a town needs to evacuate after a natural disaster, looking at individual vehicles moving out of the area and similar historical evacuations can help identify how to evacuate the town effectively in the present. Another use case was that if there was an abnormal instance happening on the road, such as a slowdown, then it could be identified to the user by looking at the vehicles, and their speed at the given moment. </p>

<div class="container">
  <div class = "row">
    <div class= "col-12">
      <h1 class="btitle">Ideation</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Understanding the Use Cases: </h4>
      <p class = "over">The discussions I had with the different stakeholders raised a lot of good points and made me think about what more value could be given to this product. I started off by first differentiating the task we were given and their relation to the use cases. I found two big standouts: One was that historical data was still important in the product, even though the focus was vehicles moving in real-time because for both the use cases, some sort of historical context was needed to evaluate the success or complication regarding an event happening in real-time. The second standout was the main phrase that everyone kept saying as they spoke about this product, “identifying anomalies.” </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Scope for Internship: </h4>
      <p class = "over">At this point, I decided to take the little that I had gathered and put together what I thought was useful for our time at the internship. While the individual vehicles moving on a map was still extremely pertinent, there were two roads we could take: scaling the project and making sure the functionality worked for any place in the world we received data from, or adding more features and focusing on one city. I decided to choose the latter, as the goal of our project was to convince the Leadership Team at INRIX to pick this project up at the end of our internship, and scale wouldn’t be as important as the viability and usefulness would be. I then decided to set milestones for our internship duration so that we could keep track of what where we were in the process:
      <br>
        1. Finish showcasing one city with the ability to view individual vehicles as moving points <br>
2. Implement colors for the points to showcase the speed that the vehicle is moving at <br>
3. Implement the direction of cars for the points <br>
4. Reach Goals:
<br>&emsp; a. Implement timeline to go back in time and showcase snapshots of historical movements of vehicles at a given region
<br>&emsp; b. Point out anomalies to users to showcase what is going wrong without the user having to look/wait for them
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Designing for the Internship: </h4>
      <p class = "over">At this point, I had to design the milestones I had set so I went ahead and made a design that had all the functionalities I talked about in the milestones.   </p>

      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Customer Interview: </h4>
      <p class = "over">However, I still wasn’t satisfied with stopping there. While I was talking to the many stakeholders earlier, I started to get the feeling that this project was much bigger than anyone may have anticipated. During one stakeholder interview with the Head of Product at INRIX, the stakeholder realized the project we were working on was similar to a few explorations for a product they thought of in the past. He had two documents outlining what they were thinking about and also a customer interview with a previous Traffic Engineer. After reading through the documents and watching the interview, I was able to put a document together, outlining how I saw our intern project developing into a full-blown product that INRIX needed. </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Competitive Research and Defining the Product at Large: </h4>
      <p class = "over">I conducted competitive research not only with products that other companies or businesses had made but also with products that had been created within INRIX. I wanted to understand where this product not only fits in the market but also within the company. This helped me define the two main goals of this product:<br>
1. Helping traffic engineers identify traffic anomalies (slowdowns, road closures, queues, and flooding events) without having to look through hours of traffic camera footage.<br>
2. Provide a birds-eye view of traffic, which could be overlapped with historical instances, to route, redirect, or evaluate individual vehicles that are moving in real-time.</p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Brainstorming and Customer Journey: </h4>
      <p class = "over">Next, based on these two key goals, I brainstormed as many features as I could to accomplish these two goals.

I organized them into viewports and made a customer journey map to understand how a potential user would go through this product from start to finish. </p>
      <center><img class = "opal1" src="img/vd1.png"></center>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Design Explorations: </h4>
      <p class = "over">After getting my journey map approved by my mentor, I then looked into creating a design system for this product. As it would be showcasing various different elements compared to what INRIX already did, such as identifying anomalies, I wanted to take sure that the design differentiated these elements while still sticking with the INRIX design system at large.  </p>

      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Initial Designs and Usability Testing: </h4>
      <p class = "over">I chose to go with visualizing the anomalies as lines versus squares or circles and started designing out the panels. However, as I designed out my initial design, seen below, I noticed that it might be hard to use. I asked a few interns who were not on my team to play around with my designs. They claimed that the side panel functionality was overbearing when there were two and took away from the main focus, which was the map.  </p>

      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Ghost Mode: </h4>
      <p class = "over">One last element that I explored during my last week was a comparison mode or something that I call Ghost Mode. This was something I played around a little with, but wasn’t able to fully flesh out due to the ending of my internship. </p>

      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Final Stakeholder Interview: </h4>
      <p class = "over">During my final presentation for my internship at INRIX, a few senior employees at the company were interested in the project I had worked on. They saw the potential for it to grow at the company in the future and wanted a more in-depth demo of what I had worked on. I met with them and got their valuable input. As I had already finished my internship at the time of this session, I documented what we had talked about in Figma for the future UX team.  </p>

      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Lessons Learned: </h4>
      <p class = "over">This was by far the most transformative and eye-opening project I worked on. When I was given the role of TPM/UX Intern, I was not totally sure how those two roles would fit together and if I would be able to even do both properly. However, I am so grateful to my mentors and boss for giving me the leeway to craft my internship. Instead of having to stick with specific directions, I was given, I was able to get out of my comfort zone, interview full-time employees at INRIX, and fully define a new product for INRIX. I learned how integrated the role of a TPM and the role of a UX Researcher or Designer is. Looking back, I am not sure if I could have worked on one job without the other. This project taught me the importance of digging deeper and not giving up till you get all the answers, as once you do, it can be really satisfying.   </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Reflection:</h4>
      <p class = "over">I am extremely grateful for this opportunity for my two summers at INRIX. I have grown so much because of this company and the kindness and mentorship everyone has given me. I would like to thank my boss Maurice and my mentors Sudha and Tony for giving me the utmost support during my summer. I would also like to thank my skip level, Kim for being such an inspiration to me. While I was the only girl on my direct intern and full-time team, having a skip level and mentor who were women gave me the courage to step up to the challenge and achieve what I could! </p>
