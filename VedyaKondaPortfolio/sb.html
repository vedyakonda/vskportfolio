      <h1 class="over">OVERVIEW</h1>
      <p class="over">In 2020, there were over 25 million students of dance in the US. However, consistent class time with an instructor can be pricey or limited, and instructors currently have no way of guaranteeing the practice needed for improvement is occurring. On top of that, 500 million people are incapable of hearing the beats in the music, and thus enter learning to dance at a distinct disadvantage. That’s where SwingBeats comes in. We’ve created Haptic Feedback Ankle Bracelets that vibrate on the user's foot to signal dancers when to do a certain step as well as provide both dancers and instructors with feedback regarding accuracy and practice time. </p>
      <p class="over">I have worked on branding and marketing for SwingBeats as the Head of User Experience. I have worked mainly on developing the logo and website as we have worked on narrowing our target audience. I am also currently working on the dashboard for our customers, dance students, and teachers, so that they may view the analytics they receive from our HFAB devices. </p>

      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Defining the problem:     </h4>
      <p class = "over">When I first joined SwingBeats, the group was very new and most of their work surrounded the hardware product they were building. It was initially a research group looking at wearable haptic technologies, however, they wanted to make the product they created more marketable. 
      <br>
      This is when I came in and was tasked with creating the website for potential customers for the ankle bracelet. However, as I started to look into design inspiration, I realized that we had to first take a step back as there was much more that needed to be done. SwingBeats didn’t even have a logo or color scheme at that point and didn’t really have their potential customer narrowed down as well. </p>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> User Research:    </h4>
      <p class = "over">Along with the team, we started doing user research and understanding who our main customer was. As one of the three dancers on the team, I knew the industry we were trying to tackle pretty well. The dance industry is conservative when it comes to teaching methods, so we needed to make sure that we catered to their ideals and needs, but also advanced the process of dance education to make it more accessible to all. This, however, raised an important point: This product wasn’t made to replace dance teachers. It was made to make dance education more accessible for students who couldn’t always travel to have dance classes. This was a tool to aid teachers and students with the new wave of online learning. While we know that the ankle bracelet could potentially tap into more industries and have more use cases, this is what we chose to focus on for our first run at this. </p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Branding</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Color Scheme and Competitive Research:  </h4>
      <p class = "over">After having a solid definition of who our customer was, I was able to start working on branding. I decided that we needed colors that were not only fun and vibrant to cater to the children and bring the brightness of dancing but also dignified and simple to cater to the older generation of teachers. I first started to look into other education websites to understand what aura they were projecting but decided to shift to looking more at dance company websites (as these are the sites that dance teachers and students are probably most comfortable with). Most of the websites I looked at, such as New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater had a strong black-and-white theme with pops of color. I recognized this to be the best balance of what I was looking for and chose black, white, and an ombre of purple to light blue.</p>
      <center><img class = "opal" src="img/sb1.png"></center>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Logo Design: </h4>
      <p class = "over">I next started to look into designing a logo that told a story but also fit the brand that we were trying to project. Initially, everyone on the team had a vision of what they wanted, which had the name SwingBeats with the s and b capitalized. People were also interested in having the letters replaced by musical notes. So I came up with a logo that fit exactly what they wanted.  </p>
      <center><img class = "opal" src="img/sb2.png"></center>
      <p class = "over">However, right away this was not liked, so I went back to the drawing board. I tried out many different fonts and designs, but I decided to go back to the team with a few. I made the whole word lowercase, but to show the separation of words, I italicized the second word. I loved how this also added movement to the word. I then added and experimented with a wave. While our product was a dance product, it didn’t make sense to have a musical note, but it was also hard to consolidate all dance forms and possibilities into one icon. So I decided to run with the word beat and signify that through a sort of wave.   </p>
      <center><img class = "opal" src="img/sb3.png"></center>
      <p class = "over">While the team approved the design above, I wasn’t completely satisfied. I felt as if the wave didn’t have meaning. It was pretty to look at, but I felt like we needed something more significant. So I started thinking about all the ways to show a sound. As I was doing research, I remembered how the voice memos app on my iPhone showed the intonations of a sound while it was recording something. This got me thinking: I recorded myself saying the word swingbeats and copied over the audio lines it had created, and this was the birth of our final logo.    </p>
      <center><img class = "opal" src="img/sb4.png"></center>
      <p>I added the word on top and created a black version and a white version for all backgrounds. I also decided to make the words more dynamic by making the words have a radial ombre. </p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Website Design</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Initial Design: </h4>
      <p class = "over">While I was sleeping on the second logo design, I started working on the first version website design. We needed to make something fairly quickly as it needed to be finished before a pitch competition we were attending the next month. Because I had to design and code the whole website, I decided to make my life easier and find a template on which to base the website. I had already done competitive research while looking for a color scheme, so I knew that I wanted the website to be similar to the Dance company websites I had observed. There needed to be a place for big pictures, vibrant colors, and text explaining our product. So I started my first design, based on the website template I had found.   </p>

      </center>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Implementation and Photography:    </h4>
      <p class = "over"> Because we were on a time crunch, and the website needed to be finished quickly, I chose to keep this simple design, but change the logo. The marketing team also gave me text to fill in the website. However, one thing I was very fixated on was the photos on the website. They were very outdated, and from the research, I had done, I understood that dancers are very visual thinkers and good without pictures, it would be hard to back up our product. I invited the Santa Clara University Tap Dance team, as the first dance form we were focusing on was tap dance and asked them to pose for me with our ankle bracelets. The picture seen on the website below is from that shoot. </p>
      <center><div class="iframe"><iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cK6bSf_adE0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></center>

      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Customer and Stakeholder Interviews:    </h4>
      <p class = "over">Once we had more time to go back and fine-tune our website, we decided to ask a few of our dancer friends, as well as an experienced product marketer to take a look at our website. All of them said the same thing regarding the fact that while our website layout was fine, it had too many words. We had a whole page on the website dedicated to explaining the hardware of our product, however, the Product Marketer explained how this was way beyond the understanding of our customer. Our customer didn’t need to know all of this information, and quite literally was giving too much of our “trade secrets” away to the public. The dancers also told us the website looked really corporate and needed to be more lively and less gray.  </p>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Version 2 Design:</h4>
      <p class = "over">I started exploring new ways to showcase our product and decided to cut down all the words, other than a short 5 sentence pitch to be spread out over the home page of the website. I also wanted the website to be more fun so I started playing around with more colors. </p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Final Product</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Final Designs: </h4>
      <p class = "over">While this was definitely fixing the problems they had raised, this design brought many more problems along with it. It had become too boxy and playful, that the essence of the product was being lost. This is when I decided to take a step back and look at what we were trying to sell: the ankle bracelet. Our technology needed to be the main focus of the website so I decided to go into Adobe Photoshop and play around with the photos we had. I cut the product out and worked around it to make the hardware the focus of the website. </p>

      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Final Implementation:  </h4>
      <p class = "over">The design above was loved by all and we decided that it not only accomplished the purpose of what we were looking for but was fun and easy to understand at the same time. I am currently working on coding this design and will add it here once it is finished. </p>

      <h1 class="btitle">Takeaways</h1>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Lessons Learned: </h4>
      <p class = "over">Working on SwingBeats has been a truly gratifying experience! Being able to work on a project long term is really exciting and especially being able to see it from the initial stages to development is something that most don’t always get to do in college. I have learned how to work with a group of students who may not have a computer science background to understand their wants, needs, and areas of expertise as well. I have also never had an experience where I have to do so much graphic design so it is exciting to see how graphic design and user experience design fit together.  </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "sstitle"> Reflection:</h4>
      <p class = "over">I am grateful to my team especially my professor Navid Shaghaghi for getting me involved in this process. As a dancer and comper scientist, this project has been so exciting as I get to bring both my passions together in a way that I never thought I could. I am extremely passionate about Education and making it more accessible for all and being able to work in this sphere and understand the user base in a detailed manner is satisfying. I hope to keep working on this project as we are now designing the dashboard for teachers and students to use to track their analytics from the hardware device.  </p>
